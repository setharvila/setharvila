## ABOUT
I am a  student studying Computer Science  at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. I have worked with a variety of languages and tools. I am continuing to develop more skills. I am still learning and still figuring out exactly where in computer science I want to focus. Right now I am passionate about web, mobile, and spatial computing.


I am always learning and always working on different projects. I am most comfortable working in Java, Swift, and Python. 
  
I am currently working as an AV Technology Student manager at North Dakota State University where I am developing skills in communicating complex problems to customers, working in and coordinating team efforts, seeing projects through to success, and advancing my skills in real time problem solving.
